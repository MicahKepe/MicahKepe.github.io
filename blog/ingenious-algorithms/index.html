      <p>Algorithms are all around us. They are the invisible forces that power our modern world, from the search engines we use to find information to the social networks we use to connect with friends and family. In this post, I will share some ingenious algorithms that are all around us and how they work.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="1-pagerank">1. PageRank</h2>
<p>When Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, they revolutionized the way we search for information on the internet. Their search engine, Google Search, used a clever algorithm called PageRank to rank web pages based on their importance and relevance to a user's query. While Google has since developed more sophisticated algorithms, PageRank remains a fundamental part of their search engine and understanding how it works can help you better understand how search engines work.</p>
<h3 id="how-pagerank-works">How PageRank Works</h3>
<h2 id="2-spell-checkers">2. Spell Checkers</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how spell checkers work? How do they know when you've misspelled a word and suggest the correct spelling? The answer lies in a clever algorithm called the Levenshtein distance algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="history-of-spell-checkers">History of Spell Checkers</h3>
<p>Spell checkers have been around for decades, but they have come a long way since their early days. The first spell checker was developed by Ralph Gorin in the late 1970s and was used by the Unix operating system. Since then, spell checkers have become an essential tool for writers, students, and professionals alike.</p>
