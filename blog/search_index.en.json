News stories like Cognition AI's Devin, albeit found to be categorically a hoax, have nonetheless fueled fears among software professionals about the future of their careers. However, the most current look at the state of AI in software development suggests a more nuanced and hopeful future.\nThe AI Job Impact Narrative\nThe narrative that AI will replace programmers is not new. This idea has pervaded movies, books, and news stories for decades dating back to the beginnings of the first wave of AI research in the 1950s following the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 (the event where the term \"artificial intelligence\" was first coined). In 1984, the Australian newspaper The Age published an article entitled \"Researchers coming with some provocative hi-tech findings\", in which the author details the opinions of two Stanford University professors, Henry Levin and Russell Rumberger, who studied employment statistics and concluded that \"high technology is no panacea for unemployment... high technology will reduce the skills required by workers in the next decade because machines will do the work. Creativity and innovation by many individual workers will suffer.\" The article goes on to quote another Stanford computer science professor, Edward Feigenbaum, a prominent artificial intelligence researcher who at the time said:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \"One of the worst pieces of advice you can give youngsters today is to\nbecome a computer programmer. Automation of software development will\ntake place in this decade and the 1990s.\"\n\n    \n    \n  \nObviously, the likes of Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, and countless other software professionals who have made their careers in the decades since would beg to differ. More recently, in 2018, McKinsey &amp; Company, a global management consulting firm, predicted that 800 million jobs would be lost to automation by 2030. In countless media outlets since, the narrative has been repeated and amplified.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: 1984 The Age Article on Artificial Intelligence\n  \n  \n\nThe proliferation of this narrative has led to widespread fear and uncertainty among software professionals. In 2019, Forbes published an article that cites a ZipRecruiter survey finding that \"One in five job seekers (one in three for those between the ages of 18 and 22) fear they will one day lose their job to AI.\" Fast forward to 2023, and a representative Gallup web poll of over 5,400 Americans found that 75% of respondents believe AI will reduce the total number of jobs in the United States in the next 10 years.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: The 2023 Gallup Poll on AI Job Impact\n  \n  \n\nHowever, we don't have to accept this narrative based solely on projections and surveys—- the data is in and the results are more optimistic than you might think.\nThe Data is In\nAnnually, Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) Institute releases a report called the AI Index. The AI Index is a comprehensive report that tracks and measures the progress of AI research and development across a variety of metrics. Here are some of the key takeaways from the 2024 report:\n\nAI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Cross-study comparison of AI's impact on task completion speed of Copilot users\n  \n  \n\n\"AI has been shown to enable workers to complete tasks more quickly and produce higher quality work. A meta-review by Microsoft, which\naggregated studies comparing the performance of workers using Microsoft Copilot or GitHub’s Copilot LLM-based productivity-enhancing tools with those who did not, found that Copilot users completed tasks in 26% to 73% less time than their counterparts without AI access\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 272)\n\nAI is creating new jobs.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Private investment in AI by geographic area, 2023\n  \n  \n\n\"The United States once again led the world in terms of total AI private\ninvestment. In 2023, the $67.2 billion invested in the United States was\nroughly 8.7 times greater than the amount invested in the next highest country,\nChina (\\$7.8 billion), and 17.8 times the amount invested in the United Kingdom\n(\\$3.8 billion)\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 247)\n\"Consistent with trends in private investment, the United States leads all regions with 897 new AI companies, followed by China with 122, and the United Kingdom with 104.\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 251)\nA great recent blog post from Builder.io, a company that builds AI-powered tools for developers, also provides a comprehensive look at the current state of AI in the software industry and also seeks to dispel the myth that AI will replace software professionals. The post states:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      By automating routine tasks and augmenting human capabilities,\nAI tools are ushering in a new golden age of software engineering.\nDevelopers who adapt and leverage these tools will find themselves\nmore productive, more creative, and more valuable than ever before.\nThe future of software engineering isn't about competing with AI —\nit's about orchestrating it to build amazing things.\n\n    \n    \n  \nDevelopers who adapt and leverage these tools will find themselves more productive, more creative, and more valuable than ever before. The future of software engineering isn't about competing with AI — it's about orchestrating it to build amazing things.') }}\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a positive outlook for the future of software development jobs, stating, \"Overall employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations from 2022 to 2032. About 377,500 openings are projected each year, on average, in these occupations due to employment growth and the need to replace workers who leave the occupations permanently.\"\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for employees in \"custom computer programming services\" from the Current Employment Statistics survey also shows a steady increase in employment over the past 10 years:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)\n  \n  \n\nHistorical Precedent: The Rise of Spreadsheets\nIn the late 1970s, the accounting industry was on the brink of a technological revolution. Before the advent of electronic spreadsheets, the accounting industry relied heavily on manual calculations and paper-based record-keeping. Accountants, clerks, and bookkeepers spent countless hours poring over ledgers, meticulously ensuring every number added up. This labor-intensive process was the norm for decades.\nThen came VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, launched in 1979. At first, many accountants were skeptical, even fearful. The idea that a piece of software could perform calculations and automate tasks traditionally done by hand was both revolutionary and terrifying. They worried about job security and the potential devaluation of their skills.\nIn the book Leading Projects with Data, author Marcus Glowasz writes:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Nowadays, no accountant would imagine doing their work by hand, but back\nthen [in the late 1970s and early 1980s], many accountants were hesitant,\nfearing that these tools would make their jobs obsolete. And, to some\nextent, their fears were well-founded. Since 1980, around 400,000 accounting\nclerks have become obsolete as spreadsheets took over their role. But\nspreadsheets made accounting more effective and easier, which resulted in\n600,000 new jobs in the accounting industry. (Glowasz, 2022, p. 138-139)\n\n    \n    \n  \nThe introduction of spreadsheets did indeed lead to the automation of many tasks previously done manually. However, it also created new opportunities and job roles that didn't exist before. By no longer having to spend hours on calculations, accountants could focus on higher-level analysis, strategy, and decision-making, leading to the emergent and lucrative roles of financial analysts, controllers, and CFOs. The fear of job loss was replaced by a newfound optimism and excitement for the future.\nOpinion: Enthusiasm for the Future\nPersonally, one of the more exciting pieces of news surrounding AI in the past year was the announcement of a new project from GitHub called GitHub Copilot Workspace. This project aims to allow developers to write their tasks in natural language and have Copilot generate the code systematically for them. As the blog post explains, the workflow for Copilot Workspace is as follows:\n\nWrite a task: Describe the task you want to accomplish in natural language in a GitHub issue or new GitHub repository.\nWorkspace creates the plan: Copilot Workspace generates a step-by-step plan to accomplish the task. The plan is entirely editable and can be tweaked to fit your needs.\nExecute the plan: Copilot Workspace generates the code for each step in the plan. You can run the code in the workspace and edit it as needed until you are satisfied with the results. You can then create a pull request to merge the code into your project.\n\nThe implications of this project are vast in my mind. Using this tool drastically lowers the barrier to entry for new developers-- you don't even need to use an IDE as GitHub already has a web-based code editor. As the article states, \"With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced developers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier of entry for who can build software... we are accelerating to a near future where one billion people on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as they ride a bicycle.\" If writing code becomes as easy as writing a natural language description of the task, the possibilities for what can be built are endless. In the same vein as VisiCalc and the rise of spreadsheets, imagine the lucrative new job roles that could emerge as programming's skill focus shifts from low-level syntax to high-level problem-solving and creativity.\nAs of the time of writing, Copilot Workspace is still only in limited technical preview, but projects like this serve to heighten my optimism and enthusiasm for the years to come in the software industry and the augmentation of our jobs as software professionals to greater creative freedom and productivity.\nReferences\n\n1984 The Age Article on Artificial Intelligence \nMcKinsey &amp; Company 2018 AI Automation Post \nForbes 2019 AI Job Impact Article \n2023 Gallup Poll on AI Job Impact \nStanford HAI's 2024 AI Index Report \nGitHub Copilot Workspace Announcement \nBuilder.io Blog Post on AI Job Impact \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \nLeading Projects with Data\n\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ai-job-impact/","title":"An Optimistic Take: AI's Augmentation of Software Professionals"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/bloom-filters/":{"body":"In the realm of computer science, efficiency is often the key to solving complex\nproblems. One elegant solution that stands out for its efficiency is the Bloom\nfilter. Despite being relatively lesser-known, Bloom filters offer a powerful\nmethod for determining set membership while using minimal space. This post\nexplores what Bloom filters are, how they work, their applications in various\nfields, and compares them with other data structures.\nWhat is a Bloom Filter?\nA Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure designed to efficiently test\nwhether an element is a member of a set. It can tell you if an element is\ndefinitely not in the set or that it might be in the set. This probabilistic\nnature makes Bloom filters incredibly space-efficient, but it also means they\ncome with a small chance of false positives.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nA Bloom filter consists of:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nA bit array of size $m$ (initially all bits are set to 0).\n$k$ independent hash functions, each of which maps an element to one of the\n$m$ array positions.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \nHow Bloom Filters Work\nInsertion\nTo add an element to the Bloom filter, the element is passed through each of the\n$k$ hash functions, resulting in $k$ array positions. The bits at these\npositions in the bit array are set to 1. If any of these bits are already set to\n1, they remain unchanged.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Inserting an element into a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nQuerying\nTo check if an element is in the Bloom filter, the element is hashed using the\nsame $k$ hash functions to find the $k$ array positions. If all the\ncorresponding bits in the bit array are 1, the Bloom filter reports that the\nelement might be in the set. If any of the bits are 0, the element is definitely\nnot in the set.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Querying an element in a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nFalse Positives\nBloom filters do not store the actual elements, so they can never have false\nnegatives (i.e., reporting an element is not in the set when it actually is).\nHowever, they can have false positives (i.e., reporting an element is in the set\nwhen it is not). The probability of false positives depends on the size of the\nbit array $m$, the number of hash functions $k$, and the number of elements\ninserted $n$.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Example of a false positive in a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nMathematical Insight\nThe false positive probability $p$ can be approximated by:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \\[ p \\approx \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{kn}\\right)^k \\]\n\n    \n    \n  \nFor practical use, choosing the optimal number of hash functions $k$ and the bit\narray size $m$ is crucial to minimize the false positive rate.\nComparing a Bloom Filter with a Hash Set in Python\nTo demonstrate the practical use of Bloom filters, let's consider a mock\nscenario where a Bloom filter is used to check if a URL is malicious. We will\ncompare Bloom filters and hash sets in terms of space efficiency and the ability\nto quickly determine if a URL is in the blacklist.\nMock Scenario: Checking Malicious URLs\nIn this scenario, we simulate a web browser that checks if a URL is malicious\nusing a locally stored Bloom filter or list. The Bloom filter offers a\nspace-efficient solution, reducing the need for frequent network calls.\n\nBloom Filter: Efficient in terms of space, but can have false positives.\nHash Set: No false positives, but can be memory-intensive.\n\nSetup and Explanation\nWe will simulate a scenario where we have 1 million URLs in a blacklist and\ncheck a large number of URLs to see if they are malicious. This will highlight\nthe space efficiency of Bloom filters compared to hash sets.\nBloom Filter\n\n    \n\nHere's the results I got when running the Bloom filter simulation:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Bloom Filter Insertion Time: 3.457702159881592 seconds\nBloom Filter Query Time: 0.10877871513366699 seconds\nFalse Positives: 121\nMemory Usage: 1.14 MB\n\n    \n    \n  \nHash Set\n\n\n\nHere's the results I got when running the hash set simulation:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Hash Set Insertion Time: 0.6073956489562988 seconds\nHash Set Query Time: 0.03299856185913086 seconds\nFalse Positives: 0\nMemory Usage: 30.15 MB\n\n    \n    \n  \nAs you can see, the hash set is significantly more memory-intensive compared to\nthe Bloom filter (30.15 MB vs. 1.14 MB). However, it does not have any\nfalse positives and is faster in terms of insertion and querying times. But,\nimagine a scenario where the blacklist is much larger, and the memory usage\nbecomes a critical factor. This is where Bloom filters shine:\n\nMemory Efficiency: Bloom filters use a fixed amount of space regardless of\nthe number of items inserted, making them ideal for applications with limited\nmemory resources.\nScalability: As the size of the data set grows, the memory usage of a hash\nset grows linearly, whereas a Bloom filter's memory usage remains constant.\nThis makes Bloom filters suitable for very large data sets.\nNetwork Latency: By storing the Bloom filter locally, we can quickly\ndetermine if a URL might be malicious without frequent network calls, reducing\nlatency and improving user experience.\n\nPros and Cons of Bloom Filters\nPros\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nSpace Efficiency: Bloom filters use minimal space compared to other data\nstructures.\nFast Set Membership Tests: Bloom filters offer constant-time set\nmembership tests.\nScalability: The memory usage of a Bloom filter remains constant\nregardless of the number of elements inserted.\nReduced I/O Operations: Bloom filters can reduce disk reads and network\ncalls by quickly filtering out non-existent elements.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nCons\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nFalse Positives: Bloom filters can produce false positives, which may not\nbe acceptable in certain applications.\nOptimal Parameters: Choosing the optimal number of hash functions and bit\narray size is crucial for minimizing false positives.\nLimited Applications: Bloom filters are best suited for scenarios where\nfalse positives are acceptable and space efficiency is critical.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nReal-World Case Studies\nCase Study: Using Bloom Filters in Google Bigtable\nGoogle Bigtable, a distributed storage system for managing structured data, uses\nBloom filters to reduce disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns. By using\nBloom filters, Bigtable can quickly determine if a row or column is absent\nwithout accessing the disk, thereby improving read performance significantly.\nThis application of Bloom filters showcases their efficiency in handling\nlarge-scale data storage and retrieval systems.\nCase Study: Akamai's Content Delivery Network (CDN)\nAkamai, one of the largest CDNs in the world, uses Bloom filters to quickly\ndetermine if content is cached on their edge servers. By using Bloom filters,\nAkamai can minimize the number of cache misses and reduce the latency of serving\ncontent to users. This helps in delivering content more efficiently and improves\nthe overall performance of the CDN.\nCase Study: Medium Duplicate Story Detection\nMedium, a popular online publishing platform, uses Bloom filters to detect\nduplicate stories. When a user submits a new story, Medium checks if the story\nis a duplicate by querying a Bloom filter that stores the hashes of previously\nsubmitted stories. This helps in identifying and preventing the publication of\nduplicate content, ensuring a better user experience for readers.\nCase Study: Bitcoin's SPV Nodes\nIn Bitcoin, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes use Bloom filters to\ntrack transactions relevant to them without downloading the entire blockchain.\nBy using Bloom filters, SPV nodes can operate more efficiently with limited\nresources, making it feasible for lightweight clients to participate in the\nBitcoin network.\nConclusion\nBloom filters are a prime example of how probabilistic data structures can offer\npowerful solutions to space and time efficiency challenges. By understanding and\nimplementing Bloom filters, you can enhance the performance of your applications\nin scenarios where quick set membership tests are critical. Despite their\nsimplicity, Bloom filters have found their way into various sophisticated\nsystems and continue to be a valuable tool in a programmer's toolkit.\nReferences\n-\nBloom Filters and SPV nodes within the bitcoin blockchain\n\n- Bloom Filter Wikipedia Page \n- Cloud Bigtable under the hood: How we improved single-row read throughput by 20-50%\n\n- University of Washington Lecture Slides on Bloom Filter Applications\n\n- Bloom Filters – Introduction and Implementation\n\n- System Design: Bloom Filter\n\n- Bloom Filter Data Structure: Implementation and Application\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/bloom-filters/","title":"Bloom Filters: Space-Efficient Probabilistic Data Structures"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ingenious-algorithms/":{"body":"Algorithms are all around us. They are the invisible forces that power our\nmodern world, from the search engines we use to find information to the social\nnetworks we use to connect with friends and family. In this post, I share some\ningenious algorithms that I have learned about both in courses and through my\nown research.\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Table of Contents\n\nPageRank\nSpell Checkers\nShazam\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n1. PageRank\nWhen Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, they revolutionized the\nway we search for information on the internet. Their search engine, Google\nSearch, used a clever algorithm called PageRank to rank web pages based on their\nimportance and relevance to a user's query. While Google has since developed\nmore sophisticated algorithms, PageRank remains a fundamental part of their\nsearch engine and understanding how it works can help you better understand how\nsearch engines work.\nHistory of PageRank\nThe idea for PageRank came to Larry Page in a dream in 1996 while he was a\ngraduate student at Stanford University. Page was interested in the problem of\nranking web pages based on their importance and relevance to a user's query. He\nrealized that the structure of the web could be used to infer the importance of\na page, just like the structure of academic citations could be used to infer the\nimportance of a research paper.\nPage and his advisor, Terry Winograd, began working on a prototype search engine\ncalled BackRub that used a simple version of PageRank to rank web pages. BackRub\nwas named after its ability to analyze the \"back links\" pointing to a given web\npage. Page and Winograd presented their work at the Seventh International World\nWide Web Conference in 1998, where it was well received by the academic\ncommunity.\nAfter the conference, Page teamed up with his friend Sergey Brin to turn BackRub\ninto a commercial search engine. They renamed the search engine Google (a play\non the word \"googol\", which means 1 followed by 100 zeros) and incorporated\nPageRank as a key part of their ranking algorithm. The rest, as they say, is\nhistory.\nHow PageRank Works\nPageRank is based on the idea that a web page's importance can be measured by\nthe number and quality of other pages that link to it. In other words, if many\nimportant pages link to a particular page, then that page must also be\nimportant. Mathematically, PageRank can be expressed as:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \\[ PR(p_i) = \\frac{1-d}{N} + d \\sum_{p_j \\in M(p_i)} \\frac{PR(p_j)}{L(p_j)} \\]\nwhere:\n\n$PR(p_i)$ is the PageRank of page $p_i$\n$N$ is the total number of pages\n$d$ is a damping factor (usually set to 0.85), which represents the\nprobability that a random surfer will continue clicking on links rather than\njumping to a random page\n$M(p_i)$ is the set of pages that link to $p_i$\n$L(p_j)$ is the number of outgoing links from page $p_j$\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nThe damping factor $d$ is used to prevent pages with many incoming links\n(\"sinks\") from having disproportionately high PageRank values since they have no\noutgoing links. Without the damping factor, the PageRank values would tend to\nconcentrate on a small number of pages, leading to a skewed ranking of search\nresults. You can think of the damping factor as a way to model the behavior of a\nrandom surfer who occasionally jumps to a random page instead of following links\n(after a certain number of clicks, the surfer gets bored and jumps to a random\npage).\nTo calculate PageRank, the algorithm starts by assigning an initial PageRank\nvalue to each page (usually $1/N$). Then, it iteratively updates the PageRank\nvalues using the above equation until convergence. The final PageRank values\nrepresent the importance of each page.\nFor example, consider a simple network of 4 web pages: A, B, C, and D. Suppose\npage B has a link to page A, page C has a link to page A, and page D has links\nto all three pages like so:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Simple network of 4 web pages: A, B, C, and D\n  \n  \n\nInitially, each page is assigned a PageRank of 0.25. After one iteration, page\nA's PageRank is updated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \\[ PR(A) = \\frac{1-0.85}{4} + 0.85 \\left( \\frac{PR(B)}{1} + \\frac{PR(C)}{1} +\n\\frac{PR(D)}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[ PR(A) = 0.0375 + 0.85 \\left(\\frac{0.25}{1} + \\frac{0.25}{1} - \\frac{0.25}{3}\\right) \\]\n\\[ PR(A) \\approx 0.46 \\]\n\n    \n    \n  \nAfter several iterations, the PageRank values converge to stable values that\nreflect the importance of each page in the network. The final PageRank values\ncan then be used to rank the pages in search results.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: PageRank GIF showing the iterative calculation of PageRank values for a simple network of web pages\n  \n  \n\nOne interesting property of PageRank is that it is a Markov chain, which means\nthat the PageRank values can be interpreted as the probability of a random\nsurfer landing on a particular page after clicking on links for a long time.\nThis interpretation has led to some interesting applications of PageRank beyond\nweb search, such as modeling the spread of disease or analyzing the structure of\nsocial networks.\nFun Facts about PageRank\n\nThe original PageRank algorithm was inspired by the way academic papers are\ncited by other papers. Just as an academic paper's importance can be measured\nby the number and quality of papers that cite it, a web page's importance can\nbe measured by the number and quality of pages that link to it.\nIn the early days of Google, the PageRank algorithm was run on a cluster of\ncheap Linux computers. On display at Stanford University is the original\nGoogle server rack, made from Lego bricks.\nPageRank has been used to rank everything from web pages to scientific papers\nto social media influencers. In fact, there are even \"PageRank for people\"\nalgorithms that try to measure the importance and influence of individuals\nbased on their social connections.\n\n\n2. Spell Checkers\nHave you ever wondered how spell checkers work? How do they know when you've\nmisspelled a word and suggest the correct spelling? The answer lies in a clever\nalgorithm called the Levenshtein distance algorithm.\nHistory of Spell Checkers\nThe history of spell checkers dates back to the early days of computing. In\n1957, a team of researchers at Bell Labs developed a program called\n\"TypoCorrect\" that could detect and correct typing errors in text. However,\nTypoCorrect was limited to a small vocabulary and could only correct errors that\nwere one letter off from the correct spelling.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began to develop more sophisticated spell\ncheckers that could handle larger vocabularies and more complex errors. One of\nthe first practical spell checkers was developed by Ralph Gorin at Stanford\nUniversity in 1971. Gorin's spell checker used a dictionary of 10,000 words and\ncould suggest corrections for misspelled words.\nIn the 1980s, spell checkers became more widely available as part of word\nprocessing software. The first spell checker for the IBM PC was developed by\nMark Skapinker and released in 1981. Microsoft Word, which was first released in\n1983, included a built-in spell checker that quickly became a standard feature\nof word processing software.\nToday, spell checkers are ubiquitous and can be found in everything from email\nclients to social media apps. Modern spell checkers use sophisticated algorithms\nand machine learning techniques to detect and correct spelling errors in\nreal-time.\nHow Spell Checkers Work\nAt the core of most spell checkers is the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which\nmeasures the similarity between two strings. The Levenshtein distance between\ntwo strings is defined as the minimum number of single-character edits\n(insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one\nstring into the other.\nFor example, the Levenshtein distance between \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" is 3,\nbecause we can transform \"kitten\" into \"sitting\" with the following edits:\n\nkitten → sitten (substitution of \"s\" for \"k\")\nsitten → sittin (substitution of \"i\" for \"e\")\nsittin → sitting (insertion of \"g\" at the end)\n\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm can be implemented using dynamic programming.\nLet $d(i, j)$ be the Levenshtein distance between the first $i$ characters of\nstring $s_1$ and the first $j$ characters of string $s_2$. Then, $d(i, j)$ can\nbe calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      $$\nd(i, j) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\max(i, j) &amp; \\text{if } \\min(i, j) = 0 \\newline\n\\min \\begin{cases}\nd(i-1, j) + 1 \\newline\nd(i, j-1) + 1 \\newline\nd(i-1, j-1) + 1*{s_1[i] \\neq s_2[j]}\n\\end{cases} &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $1*{s_1[i] \\neq s_2[j]}$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the $i$-th\ncharacter of $s_1$ is not equal to the $j$-th character of $s_2$, and 0\notherwise.\n\n    \n    \n  \nTo check the spelling of a word, a spell checker typically compares the word to\na dictionary of correctly spelled words using the Levenshtein distance\nalgorithm. If the Levenshtein distance between the word and its closest match in\nthe dictionary is below a certain threshold, the spell checker assumes the word\nis correctly spelled. Otherwise, it suggests the closest match(es) as possible\ncorrections.\nOne interesting variant of the Levenshtein distance algorithm is the\nDamerau-Levenshtein distance, which allows for transpositions of adjacent\ncharacters in addition to insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This variant\nis useful for catching common typing errors like \"teh\" instead of \"the\".\nFun Facts about Spell Checkers\n\nThe first spell checker was developed for the Unix operating system and was\ncalled \"spell\". It used a simple algorithm that compared each word to a\ndictionary of correctly spelled words.\nEarly spell checkers were notoriously bad at handling proper nouns and\ntechnical jargon. Modern spell checkers use more sophisticated techniques,\nsuch as machine learning, to improve their accuracy.\nSome spell checkers can even catch homophones (words that sound the same but\nare spelled differently), such as \"their\" vs. \"there\" vs. \"they're\".\nSpell checkers have been used for more than just correcting spelling errors.\nIn 2018, researchers at the University of Michigan developed a spell checker\nthat could detect signs of Alzheimer's disease in writing samples by looking\nfor subtle changes in language use over time.\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm has applications beyond spell checking,\nsuch as DNA sequence alignment and plagiarism detection.\n\n\n3. Shazam\nHave you ever heard a song playing and wondered what it was called or who sang\nit? Shazam is a popular app that can identify songs based on a short audio clip.\nThe algorithm behind Shazam is ingenious in its simplicity and effectiveness.\nHistory of Shazam\nThe idea for Shazam came to co-founder Chris Barton in 1999 when he was a\nstudent at the University of California, Berkeley. Barton was at a bar with\nfriends and heard a song he liked but didn't know the name of. He thought it\nwould be great if there was a way to identify songs using a phone.\nBarton teamed up with Avery Wang, a PhD student in audio signal processing, to\ndevelop the algorithm behind Shazam. Wang had previously worked on a system for\nidentifying bird songs based on their spectrograms, and he realized that a\nsimilar technique could be used to identify music.\nBarton and Wang founded Shazam in 2000 and launched the first version of the app\nin 2002. At the time, the app could only identify a small number of songs and\nrequired users to call a special phone number and hold their phone up to the\nmusic. However, the app quickly gained popularity and began to expand its\ndatabase of songs.\nIn 2008, Shazam launched an iPhone app that allowed users to identify songs\ndirectly from their phone. This version of the app used the phone's built-in\nmicrophone to capture the audio and send it to Shazam's servers for\nidentification. The iPhone app was a huge success and helped to drive Shazam's\ngrowth.\nToday, Shazam is one of the most popular music recognition apps in the world,\nwith over 1 billion downloads and 20 million song identifications per day. In\n2018, Shazam was acquired by Apple for a reported $400 million.\nHow Shazam Works\nAt a high level, Shazam works by converting an audio clip into a \"fingerprint\"\nthat can be compared to a database of known songs. The fingerprint is created\nusing a clever algorithm called the spectrogram peak finding algorithm.\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe audio clip is divided into short overlapping segments (called \"frames\")\nand the frequency spectrum of each frame is calculated using the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT).\nThe spectrogram (a visual representation of the frequency spectrum over time)\nis analyzed to identify \"peaks\" (local maxima) in the frequency domain. These\npeaks correspond to the dominant frequencies in the audio clip.\nThe time and frequency coordinates of each peak are combined to create a\n\"hash\" (a unique identifier) for that peak.\nThe hashes for all the peaks in the clip are combined to create a fingerprint\nfor the clip.\nThe fingerprint is compared to a database of fingerprints for known songs\nusing a technique called \"combinatorial hashing\".\nIf a match is found, the song is identified and returned to the user.\n\nThe key insight behind Shazam is that the spectrogram peaks are robust to noise\nand distortion, so they can be used to identify songs even in noisy environments\nor when the audio quality is poor.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Spectrogram of 'Blurred Lines' by Robin Thicke.\n  \n  \n\nFor example, suppose you're at a noisy bar and hear a song playing that you want\nto identify. You open up Shazam and record a 10-second clip of the song. Shazam\nthen converts the clip into a spectrogram and identifies the peaks.\nThe peaks are then hashed and combined into a fingerprint, which is compared to\nShazam's database of over 11 million songs. Even though the clip is noisy and\ndistorted, Shazam is still able to find a match and identify the song.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Signal matching in Shazam.\n  \n  \n\nOne interesting aspect of Shazam's algorithm is that it uses a technique called\n\"combinatorial hashing\" to efficiently search its database of song fingerprints.\nCombinatorial hashing works by dividing the fingerprint into smaller\nsubfingerprints and searching for matches for each subfingerprint separately.\nThis allows Shazam to identify songs quickly even though its database contains\nmillions of songs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Excerpt from Shazam's patent showing the process of identifying a song.\n  \n  \n\n\nFun Facts about Shazam\n\nShazam's database contains over 11 million songs and is growing every day.\nShazam has been used to identify over 50 billion songs since its launch\nin 2002.\nThe most Shazamed song of all time is \"Dance Monkey\" by Tones and I, which has\nbeen identified over 36.6 million times.\nShazam's algorithm can identify a song in as little as 1 second, even if the\naudio quality is poor or there is background noise.\nShazam's co-founder Avery Wang is also an accomplished classical pianist and\nhas performed at Carnegie Hall.\n\nConclusion\nThese are just a few examples of the many ingenious algorithms that power our\nmodern world. From search engines to spell checkers to music recognition apps,\nalgorithms are all around us, working behind the scenes to make our lives easier\nand more efficient. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see\neven more clever algorithms emerge to solve new problems and challenges.\nThe next time you use a search engine to find information, correct a spelling\nmistake, or identify a song, take a moment to appreciate the algorithms that\nmake it all possible. They may be invisible, but they are the unsung heroes of\nthe digital age.\n\nReferences\n-\nLarry Page's University of Michigan commencement address\n\n- Google’s PageRank: The Math Behind the Search Engine\n\n- The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\n\n- PageRank GIF Source \n- The Levenshtein-Damerau Distance\n\n- Shazam: An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm\n\n- How on Earth Does Shazam Recognize Songs\n\n- How does Shazam Uniquely Identify A Track?\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ingenious-algorithms/","title":"Ingenious Algorithms We Take for Granted: PageRank, Spell Checkers, and Shazam"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/missing-semester/":{"body":"Nearly a year ago, I took an online course called\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education.

It is meant to be a\nmore user-friendly alternative to checkout for switching branches. The\nswitch command is more intuitive and easier to use than checkout, especially\nfor beginners. It is also more consistent with other Git commands, such as\ngit branch and git merge.\n1.2 Learning to use rebase\n\nA diagram of the rebase process:\n1. Initial State\n\nAs you can see, the feature branch has diverged from the main branch with\ncommits D and E, which are behind commit C on the main branch.\n2. After running git rebase main on the feature branch\n\nAfter rebasing, two new commits D' and E' are created on the feature\nbranch, which have new commit hashes from the original commits D and E.\nIf there are any conflicts during the rebase process, you will need to resolve\nthem before continuing.\n3. After running git switch main and git merge feature-branch\n\nFinally, the feature branch is merged back into the main branch. Now we have a\nlinear commit history!\nA key benefit of rebasing is that it keeps the commit history clean and linear,\nmaking it easier to understand and navigate.\n\nNOTE It is important to note that rebasing rewrites commit history, so it should be\nused with caution, especially when working on shared branches with\ncollaborators. If working with others, use the --force-with-lease flag when\npushing rebased commits to a shared branch. This flag ensures that if your\nchanges conflict with the remote branch, you will not overwrite someone else's\nwork.\n\n1.3 Stashing changes\n\nThere are many other useful Git commands and techniques, but these are some of\nthe ones that I use most frequently in my day-to-day work. The best way to learn\nGit is by actually using it, struggling with it, and learning from others.\nAgain, Git can be tricky and it takes practice— Linus Torvalds, the creator of\nGit, wrote in the initial commit message of Git that it stands for:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n'global information tracker': you're in a good mood, and it actually\nworks for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\n'goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t': when it breaks\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\n2. Hammerspoon\nHammerspoon is an automation tool available for macOS that runs on custom Lua\nscripts. The greatest use case that I found for it was for writing scripts to\nallow me to use custom keyboard bindings to control the sizing and location of\nmy windows without having to use the mouse.\nWhile this seems like it a relatively small enhancement, the seconds saved from\nevery time I need to resize a window compound into minutes and hours saved over\ntime. Here's a snippet of the window.lua script I wrote to do this:\n\nI have not yet explored all the capabilities of Hammerspoon, but this one\nfeature alone has made it a valuable tool for me. I highly recommend checking it\nout if you are a macOS user and are looking to automate repetitive tasks or\ncreate custom keyboard shortcuts. For more information on Hammerspoon, check out\nthe official documentation.\n3. Dotfiles\nDotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize the settings of\nvarious programs and tools. They are typically stored in the home directory of a\nuser and are prefixed with a . (e.g., .bashrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig). The\ncourse introduced me to the concept of dotfiles and the benefits of storing them\nin a version-controlled repository. Additionally, setting up aliases dotfiles\ncan help you streamline your workflow and make your development environment more\nefficient.\nBy storing your dotfiles in a version-controlled repository, you can easily\nsynchronize your configurations across multiple machines and share them with\nothers. Additionally, you can keep track of changes to your configurations over\ntime and revert to previous versions if needed. If you ever switch to a new\nmachine or need to set up a new environment, you can quickly install your\ndotfiles and have your familiar configurations ready to go, especially if you\nwrite a bootstrap script to automate the process.\n3.1 Helpful aliases\nAliases are shortcuts that you can define in your dotfiles to make common\ncommands easier to type and remember. Here are some examples of aliases that you\ncan add to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make your life easier:\n\nIn my .gitconfig file, I have also set up aliases to enhance the graph and\nlog commands:\n\n3.2 Setting up a dotfiles repository\nTo set up a dotfiles repository, you can follow these steps:\n1. Create a new directory for your dotfiles repository in your home directory:\n\n2. Initialize a new Git repository in the directory:\n\n3. Move your dotfiles into the repository and create symbolic links to them in\nyour home directory:\n\nYou can view all of your configuration files with the following command:\n\nConfiguration files that are prefixed with a . are typically hidden by\ndefault, so you may need to use the -a flag to display them.\nIf you have set up the symbolic links correctly, running the ls -a ~ command\nshould show the symbolic links in your home directory pointing to the dotfiles\nin your repository like so:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: My dotfiles in my home directory symlinked to my dotfiles repository.\n  \n  \n\n4. Add, commit, and push your dotfiles to your remote repository (e.g.,\nGitHub):\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a centralized repository for your\ndotfiles and easily manage your configurations across multiple machines. You can\nalso share your dotfiles with others and benefit from the productivity\nenhancements that they provide.\nThe great thing about dotfiles repositories is that doing a simple search on\nGitHub will yield many examples of how others have set up their dotfiles. You\ncan learn from their configurations and customize them to suit your own\npreferences. If you're interested in seeing an example of a dotfiles repository,\nyou can check out mine.\nConclusion\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education is a fantastic course that covers a\nwide range of topics that are essential for becoming a more productive and\nefficient programmer. The course has helped me improve my skills in version\ncontrol, automation, and configuration management, and I continue to use many of\nthe tools and techniques that I learned in my day-to-day work.\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/missing-semester/","title":"Biggest Takeaways from The Missing Semester of Your CS Education"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/neovim-setup/":{"body":"Over the summer, after finally getting around to learning Vim motions (see blog\npost #9), I quickly fell down the\nNeovim rabbithole and have been procrastinating work by tinkering away at my\nconfigurations ever since!

Vim quickly became popular due to its efficiency and ability to\nperform complex text manipulations with minimal keystrokes.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The original Vi program running with 'visuals'\n  \n  \n\nHowever, Vim had its limitations, especially with handling modern development\nfeatures such as better plugin systems, scripting flexibility, and ease of\nconfiguration. Neovim, a fork of Vim, was initiated in 2014\nto address these challenges and provide a more modern, extensible framework.\nNeovim differentiates itself by embracing the Lua programming language for\nfaster, more customizable configurations. This shift has given rise to a\nflourishing ecosystem of plugins that are tailored to extend Neovim’s\ncapabilities—from file navigation and autocompletion to even embedding images\ninside your text editor.\nGetting Started with Neovim\nIf you want to follow along with setup, you can install Neovim by following the\ninstructions below. If you already have Neovim installed, you can skip ahead to\nthe setup.\nTo install Neovim, check the\nINSTALL.md file on\nthe Neovim repository for the instructions for your machine.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Setup\nFirst off, a confession. I am not using off the shelf Neovim but starting from\na very strong base configuration provided by the awesome folks at\nNVChad. NVChad is not a Neovim distro, but an opinionated\nstarting Neovim configuration that provides a great starting place.\nI particularly like NVChad for the following reasons:\n\n\nPre-configured LSP: NVChad provides a hassle-free Language Server Protocol\n(LSP) setup.\n\n\nLazy-loading Plugins: With the lazy.nvim plugin\nmanager, NVChad optimizes startup time by only loading plugins when necessary.\n\n\nRich Theming: NVChad comes with lots of themes and color schemes to choose\nfrom (I am currently using\npalenight).\n\n\nCommunity Support: NVChad’s community\nis active, and the configuration gets frequent updates and improvements.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you are following along, let's first install NVChad before we continue:\nFor Mac and Linux Users:\n\nWindows Users:\nA little more complicated (as usual), check out the install documentation\nhere\nChanges to NVChad's Default Settings\nDiagnostics Menu\nOne of the things I changed from NVChad was the diagnostics display. By default,\nNVChad has the diagnostics displayed inline in red text. One consequence of this\nis that long diagnostic messages do not wrap at the end of the buffer, making it\ndifficult to read the entire message:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    NvChad default diagnostics\n  \n  \n\nTo make the diagnostics more readable and \"Visual-Studio-Code-like\", I changed\nthe diagnostics to underline the offending line and display to a floating window\nat the offending line on a cursor hold:\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nTo do this, I created a separate file for the diagnostics configuration in\nnvim/lua/configs/diagnostics.lua:\n\nThen to load this configuration, I added the following lines to the top of my\nnvim/lua/configs/lspconfig.lua:\n\nEnable Hidden Files in nvim-tree Display\nAnother change I made was to show hidden files in the nvim-tree file explorer.\nBy default, hidden files are not displayed in the file explorer, which can be a\nlittle annoying when you need to access a .gitignore, configuration files, or\na .env file, for example.\nTo do this, I altered the section in the nvim/lua/init.lua file that loads\nNvChad's defined plugins:\n\nIn the nvim_tree_options.filters.custom table above, I added \"^\\\\.git$\" and\n\"DS_Store\" regular expressions to not display files from the .git/ folder,\nand to ignore the .DS_Store files that macOS creates, respectively.\n\nPlugins\nI won't be detailing every plugin that I use, but instead the ones that have\nbecome staples in my editing experience. All plugins snippets that follow will\nbe using lazy.nvim install configurations. I will break this section into the\nplugins that come by default from NVChad and the plugins that I have added on.\n\nNote: If you are curious about all of my plugins, you can see them\nhere.\n\n\nNVChad Plugins\nNVChad comes with a carefully curated set of plugins that provide a solid\nfoundation for your Neovim setup. Here are some of the key plugins included:\n\n\nnvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua: A\nfile explorer tree for Neovim written in Lua. It provides a sleek and\ncustomizable way to navigate your project files.\n\n\nnvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter:\nTreesitter configurations and abstraction layer for Neovim. It provides better\nsyntax highlighting and code understanding.\n\n\nlewis6991/gitsigns.nvim:\nGit integration for buffers. It shows which lines have been added, removed, or\nmodified in the gutter.\n\n\nhrsh7th/nvim-cmp: A completion\nplugin for Neovim coded in Lua. It provides autocompletion functionality similar\nto what you'd find in modern IDEs.\n\n\nwilliamboman/mason.nvim:\nPortable package manager for Neovim that runs everywhere Neovim runs. Easily\ninstall and manage LSP servers, DAP\ndebugger servers, linters, and formatters.\n\n\nneovim/nvim-lspconfig: A\ncollection of common configurations for Neovim's built-in LSP client.\n\n\nfolke/which-key.nvim: Displays\na popup with possible key bindings of the command you started typing.\nIncredibly useful for discovering and remembering mappings.\n\n\nnvim-telescope/telescope.nvim:\nA highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. It helps you search, filter, find,\nand pick things in your Neovim setup.\n\n\nThese plugins work together to provide a fully-featured IDE-like experience\nright out of the box. NVChad's setup ensures that these plugins are configured\nto work well together, providing a smooth and cohesive editing experience.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\n\nAdded Plugins \"Musts\"\nIn no particular order, here are the plugins that I have added to augment\nNVChad's base.\ngelguy/wilder.nvim\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\nMakes navigating the Neovim command line much faster with fuzzy search\ncapabilities, providing instant suggestions as you type commands.\nWhen executing a command or searching, wilder.nvim offers a real-time list of\nsuggestions based on your command history, file paths, and available commands.\nThis dramatically speeds up workflows that involve repeated or complex command\nusage.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n3rd/image.nvim\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\nEnables image rendering in Neovim, essential for tasks like markdown previews\nand documentation editing. When editing markdown files or any other file format\nthat supports images, image.nvim renders inline images. This eliminates the need\nto switch to a browser or other external tool, making Neovim more than just a\ntext editor—it's a media-enabled workspace.\nHonestly this one was a pain in the ass to setup but worth it.\nI did have to make the switch to the Kitty\nterminal emulator from iTerm2 as they implement\ndifferent terminal image protocols (kitty vs. imgcat) and Kitty's protocol\nhas more support as of writing. Additionally, getting the right Luarocks\nversion (5.1) is a little tricky as it is an older version of Luarocks.\nHonestly, I needed images in Neovim in order to even consider making the switch\nfrom Visual Studio Code, so getting this plugin working was a non-negotiable for\nme.\n\nNote: This particular configuration of the plugin must be run in Kitty to\nwork. See the backend option if you want to use a different emulator.\n\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nrmagatti/autosession\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\nAutomatically saves and restores Neovim sessions, allowing you to pick up your\nwork right where you left off. If you close Neovim and reopen it later,\nautosession will restore your previous session (open files, split windows,\netc.). This is incredibly useful when you are juggling multiple projects and\nwant to resume exactly where you left off.\nlazy.nvim:\n\nThen I define these mappings to save and restore sessions:\n\n\nchristoomey/vim-tmux-navigator\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\nEnables smooth navigation between Neovim windows and\ntmux panes, making it feel like a unified\nexperience. If you’re using tmux and Neovim together,vim-tmux-navigator allows\nyou to navigate between tmux panes and Neovim splits using the same keybindings\n(like &lt;C-h&gt;,&lt;C-j&gt;, &lt;C-k&gt;, and &lt;C-l&gt;). This makes my workflow more fluid\nas I don't have to think about whether I'm moving inside Neovim or across Tmux.\nNot to mention I find this bindings much less awkward than the default &lt;C-w&gt;\nVim windown motions.\nThe true value of this plugins comes when you are working in various tmux panes\nrunning a combination of Neovim, a shell, and other tools. Without thinking I\ncan navigate between these panes with ease.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nNote: If using NVChad, you will need to override its mapping of these keys\nto use the Tmux navigation commands instead:\n\n\nIf using tmux, add the following to your ~/.tmux.conf:\n\npocco81/auto-save.nvim\nAutomatically saves your files when you leave insert mode. This plugin is a\nlifesaver for those who forget to save their work frequently. It ensures that\nyour changes are always saved, even if you forget to do so manually. It is also\nhighly customizable, allowing you to configure the save interval and other\nsettings to suit your workflow.\nlazy.nvim:\n\nstevearc/dressing.nvim\n\n  \n  \n\nThis plugins provides way better styling to the default vim.ui interfaces. The\nbiggest improvement in my opinion is over the vim.input interface that is used\nfor renaming files in nvim-tree and renaming variable definitions using\nNvChad's renamer. This is another highly customizable plugin that allows you to\nstyle the UI to your liking.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nKey Mappings\nSimilarly, I have a ton of mappings that I have defined so I will just be going\nover the ones that I can't live without. Additionally, I will not be detailing\nthe mappings that come with the NVChad base configuration (NVChad users can view\nthese by doing &lt;leader&gt;ch to pull up the mappings cheat sheet).\nQuality of Life Remaps\n\n\"Reveal in Finder\" Dupe\nOne of the things that I was missing coming from Visual Studio Code was the\noption in the file explorer to \"Reveal in Finder\" so I created a simple Vim user\ncommand that allows me to open a file under in my cursor in a Finder window\neither from the open file buffer or from the file explorer sidebar.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\n\nWindow Management\nThese mappings manage window splits and layout efficiently in Neovim. The desc\nkey provides a description of the mapping for use in command help or plugins\nlike which-key.nvim.\n\nVisually Appealing Scrolling and Searching\nThese mappings keep the cursor and search result centered in the window while\nscrolling or jumping to search results.\n\nGitSigns Mappings\nThese are the mappings I use for GitSigns, which I believe are fairly standard.\ngitsigns works in \"hunks\" of code, hence all of these mappings begin with an\nh after the leader.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n\n\n\nOptions\nThese options provide a basic, yet highly functional configuration for Neovim\nthat enhances usability by enabling features like clipboard integration and\nbetter search behavior.\n\nConclusion\nWhile transitioning from VSCode to Neovim wasn’t without its challenges—\nespecially getting used to Vim motions and configuring the plugins to my\nliking—it has ultimately made my workflow faster and more enjoyable. I\nparticularly appreciated how customizable Neovim is; I can tailor it exactly to\nmy needs, unlike most GUI-based editors.\nIt took me about a month to feel completely comfortable using Neovim, but once\nthe muscle memory kicks in, you start to realize the immense productivity boost.\nIf you’re on the fence, I highly recommend giving Neovim a chance for at least a\nfew weeks.\nIf you have any questions about my setup, want to share your own tips and tricks,\nor just want to chat about Neovim, feel free to write in the comments below!\nReferences\n- Understanding the Origins and the Evolution of Vi &amp; Vim \n- How I Setup Neovim On My Mac To Make it AMAZING in 2024\n \n- NVChad Documentation \n- An Experienced (Neo)Vimmer's Workflow. \n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/neovim-setup/","title":"Setting Up a Supercharged Neovim Configuration"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/software-packages/":{"body":"How do software packages work behind the scenes? How are they created, distributed, and installed? In this post, we'll explore the lifecycle of software packages, from creation to installation, using the Node Package Manager (NPM) and the Autoprefixer package as real-world examples.\nIntroduction\nWhat Are Software Packages?\nChances are, you've used a software package. Software packages are collections of code, resources, and metadata that provide specific functionality. They can be libraries, tools, or applications that help developers build software more efficiently.\nFor example, this website uses various software packages like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive, and interactive user experience. These packages provide pre-built functionality that developers can leverage in their projects. Software packages are essential for modern software development, enabling code reuse, dependency management, and efficient development workflows.\nHow Do Software Packages Work?\nCreation and Distribution\nCreating a software package involves writing code (shocker) that provides a specific functionality and then packaging it with metadata, documentation, and licensing information. The packaged code can then be published to a repository like NPM (Node Package Manager), making it available for others to use. Here's a simplified overview:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nWrite the Code: Develop the core functionality of your package.\nPackage the Code: Include metadata, documentation, and licensing information.\nPublish: Upload the package to a repository like NPM.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nInstallation and Dependency Management\nWhen you install a software package using a package manager like NPM, the package manager handles the downloading and installation of the package along with its dependencies. Dependencies are other packages that your package relies on to function correctly.\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nDownload: The package and its dependencies are fetched from the repository.\nInstall: The package and its dependencies are installed in your project.\nConfigure: The package manager ensures that all dependencies are compatible.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nDependency Resolution\nDependency resolution is the process of determining which versions of dependencies to install to ensure compatibility and prevent conflicts. NPM uses the package-lock.json file to lock the versions of installed packages, ensuring that the same versions are used if the project is shared with others.\nA Brief Overview of Package Managers and NPM\nPackage managers like NPM are crucial tools in modern development workflows. They handle the distribution, installation, and management of software packages, making it easier for developers to build and maintain their projects.\npackage.json\nThe package.json file is the heart of any Node.js project. It contains various metadata relevant to the project, such as the project’s name, version, description, main entry point, scripts, dependencies, and more.\npackage-lock.json\nThe package-lock.json file is automatically generated when you run npm install. It locks the versions of installed packages, ensuring that the same versions are used if the project is shared with others.\nReal-World Example: Autoprefixer\nNow, let's look at the Autoprefixer package, which is one of packages used for this website and is used to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules to ensure cross-browser compatibility.\nDirectory Structure\nHere's the directory structure of the Autoprefixer package in node_modules:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n    \n  \n\nFiles and Their Purposes\nFile/DirectoryPurpose\nLICENSE &amp; README.mdThese files provide licensing information and documentation for the package.\nbin/autoprefixerThis script file is used for executing the Autoprefixer tool from the command line.\ndata/prefixes.jsContains data about the CSS prefixes.\nlib/This directory contains the core code for the Autoprefixer package, organized into various modules.\n\npackage.json\nHere's the package.json file for Autoprefixer:\n\n\nLet's break down some key fields in the package.json file:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nname: The name of the package.\nversion: The current version of the package.\ndescription: A brief description of what the package does.\nengines: Specifies the versions of Node.js that are compatible with this package.\nkeywords: Keywords that help identify the package in searches.\nmain: The entry point for the package.\nbin: The executable file for the package.\ntypes: The TypeScript declaration file for the package.\nfunding: Information about how the package is funded.\nauthor: The author of the package.\nlicense: The license under which the package is released.\nrepository: The repository where the source code is hosted.\nbugs: The URL where issues can be reported.\npeerDependencies: Other packages that are required for this package to work correctly.\ndependencies: The packages that this package depends on.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \n\nCreating a Software Package (Example: date-formatter)\nTo illustrate the creation of a software package, let's build a hypothetical example package called date-formatter. This package will provide functions to format dates in various ways. We'll use Node.js and NPM for this example.\nStep 1: Setting Up Your Project\n\n\nInitialize the project:\n\n\n\nAdd some functionality:\nCreate an index.js file with a simple date formatting function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Preparing for Distribution\nBefore distributing the package, you should ensure it has proper documentation, licensing, and metadata.\n\n\nAdd a README file:\n\n\n\n\nAdd a LICENSE file:\nChoose a license for your package and add a LICENSE file. For example, an MIT license. The license is important for clarifying how others can use your package.\n\n\nUpdate the package.json file:\nAdd an entry point to the index.js file and specify the main functionality of the package.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Publishing the Package\nNow that your package is ready, you can publish it to the NPM registry for others to use.\n\n  Create an NPM account:\nIf you don't already have one, create an account on NPM.\n\nLogin to NPM:\n\n\nPublish the package:\n\nThis command will upload the package to the NPM registry. This registry is a\nlarge database that stores all the packages and their versions. When someone\nruns npm install &lt;package-name&gt;, NPM searches the registry for the package,\ndownloads it, and installs it along with its dependencies.\nThe NPM registry ensures that packages are easily discoverable and accessible\nto developers around the world. It also handles versioning, so developers can\nspecify which versions of a package they need, and NPM will resolve dependencies\naccordingly.\nCongratulations! Your package is now available for others to\ninstall and use.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nUnderstanding how software packages work, from creation to distribution to installation, is fundamental for modern software development. By examining a real-world example like Autoprefixer and creating a hypothetical package, we've seen the key components and processes involved in package management.\nI hope that this article demystified the world of software packages and inspired you to explore the vast ecosystem of packages available to developers. Whether you're building a simple utility or a complex application, software packages can help you save time, reduce errors, and focus on what matters most: building great software.\nReferences\n\nNPM Documentation \nWhat is Software Package? \nPackage Manager (Wikipedia) \nCreating and publishing scoped public packages\n\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/software-packages/","title":"How Do Software Packages Work?"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/sqlite-query-optimizer/":{"body":"I love databases, but they are still largely a magical black box to me, so in this post, I'm going to explore how SQLite's query optimizer works. We'll delve together into the process of how SQL queries are parsed, optimized, and executed, with a particular focus on the optimization phase. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how SQLite's query optimizer works and how it can help you write more efficient queries.\n\nThis past summer, I got a lot of practice learning the ins and outs of SQLite as part of a project that I have been contributing to, which we originally set up with a SQLite database. I've been working with SQLite for a while now, and I've come to appreciate its simplicity and ease of use.\nWhat Actually Happens When You Run a Query?\nRegardless of the database engine you're using, when you run a query, the database engine goes through a series of steps to execute the query. These steps include:\n\nWriting: The query is written and sent to the database engine.\nParsing: The query is parsed to ensure it is syntactically correct.\nPlanning: The query planner generates an execution plan for the query.\nExecution: The query is actually executed and the results are returned.\n\nOf course, while these steps are common to all database engines, the way they are implemented can vary significantly from one engine to another.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Overview of the query execution process\n  \n  \n\nSQLite's Approach to Query Optimization\nBecause SQLite is open source and has a small codebase, it’s relatively easy to understand how it works. The query optimizer in SQLite might seem like a modest engine at first glance, but under the hood, it's a sophisticated piece of software that makes smart decisions to ensure your queries run efficiently.\nSQLite's query optimizer uses several different strategies to optimize query performance:\n\n\nIndex Selection: SQLite intelligently selects the best indexes to speed up data retrieval. It considers various factors, such as the columns in the WHERE clause and the order in which they appear.\n\n\nJoin Ordering: For queries that involve joins, SQLite tries to figure out the most efficient order to join the tables. It uses heuristics and statistics to make an educated guess that minimizes the computational cost.\n\n\nSubquery Flattening: SQLite tries to flatten subqueries, meaning it attempts to merge subqueries into the main query whenever possible. This reduces the overhead of executing multiple queries separately.\n\n\nCovering Indexes: If an index contains all the columns needed by the query, SQLite can retrieve the results directly from the index without accessing the actual table, significantly speeding up the query.\n\n\nCost Estimation: SQLite uses a cost-based query planner, which estimates the cost of different execution plans and chooses the one with the lowest estimated cost. The cost is generally a measure of how much disk I/O and CPU time will be consumed.\n\n\nThese strategies help SQLite balance efficiency and performance, making it an excellent choice for applications where lightweight and quick database operations are essential.\nSimple Example Query\nNow that we have a basic understanding of how SQLite's query optimizer works, let's take a look at a simple example query and see how it's optimized.\nBorrowing from the Rice University legend, Dr. Christopher Jermaine, let's say we have the following relational schema:\n\nFor demonstration, I'll be using the SQLite Online Compiler to run the queries. Suppose we want to find all the beers that Ava likes with the following query:\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Results of the simple query\n  \n  \n\nAs we can see, we get the expected results for this query. But how does SQLite's query optimizer actually execute this query?\nAnalyzing the Query: Breaking Down SQLite's Execution Process\n1. Parsing the Query\nThe first thing SQLite does is parse the SQL statement. The parser checks the query for any syntax errors and builds a parse tree—a hierarchical representation of the query. This step ensures that the SQL statement is valid and prepares it for further processing.\n2. Generating the Execution Plan\nAfter parsing, SQLite moves on to the query planning phase, where it generates an execution plan. An execution plan is a step-by-step roadmap of how SQLite will retrieve the data. This involves several key decisions:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n\nTable Access Method: SQLite needs to decide how to access the LIKES table. Since the WHERE clause filters rows based on the DRINKER column, SQLite considers whether there's an index on DRINKER that can speed up the retrieval.\n\n\nIndex Usage: If there were an index on the DRINKER column, SQLite might use it to directly look up rows where DRINKER = 'Ava'. However, in this case, there’s no such index, so SQLite will perform a full table scan.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n  \nWe can inspect the execution plan using the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command:\n\nAs expected since there's no index on the DRINKER column, the output is:\n\n3. Full Table Scan Explained\nThe plan indicates \"SCAN LIKES,\" meaning SQLite will read through the entire LIKES table, row by row, to find matches where DRINKER = 'Ava'. Here’s how it works:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nSQLite starts at the first row of the LIKES table and checks if the DRINKER column equals 'Ava'.\nIf it matches, SQLite includes the BEER column from that row in the result set.\nThis process repeats for every row in the table.\n\n\n    \n    \n  \nEven though a full table scan is the least efficient method (especially with large tables), it’s the only option when no suitable index is available. For small tables like our example, the performance impact is minimal, but with larger datasets, this could become a bottleneck.\n4. Using Rowid Lookups for Efficiency\nWhile full table scans are sometimes necessary, SQLite often relies on rowid lookups to speed up queries when no more specific index is available. Each table in SQLite has a unique identifier for each row called the rowid. If your query involves this rowid directly, SQLite can perform a binary search on this identifier, which is significantly faster than a full table scan.\nFor example, consider the following query:\n\nIn this case, SQLite will directly use the rowid to locate the record, bypassing the need to scan every row in the table. This technique can be particularly useful when you know the specific rowid of the data you need to retrieve.\n5. Execution: Returning the Results\nOnce the execution plan is ready, SQLite moves to the execution phase. The database engine follows the plan, scanning the LIKES table, filtering rows, and collecting the BEER values where DRINKER is 'Ava'. The results are then returned to the user.\nIn this simple case, the query returns:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      Bud Light\nPabst\nMiller Lite\n\n    \n    \n  \nThese results match what we expected because the query is straightforward and the table is small.\n6. Optimizing the Query (The What-If Scenario)\nLet’s imagine we want to optimize this query. The most effective way would be to create an index on the DRINKER column. With an index, SQLite could:\n\nSkip the Full Table Scan: Instead of scanning the entire table, SQLite could directly jump to the rows where DRINKER = 'Ava', significantly speeding up the query.\n\nHere’s how you could create the index:\n\nWith this index, if you run the same query again:\n\nSQLite would use the index to find all rows with DRINKER = 'Ava' directly, reducing the amount of work it needs to do.\nNow when we EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command to inspect how SQLite would handle the query now, we see:\n\nThis indicates that SQLite is now using the idx_drinker index to perform a much faster search. Instead of scanning the entire table, it quickly narrows down the relevant rows using the index, demonstrating a significant improvement in query performance.\nTakeaways from the Simple Query Example\nThis simple example highlights how SQLite’s query optimizer works in the background to execute SQL queries efficiently. While a full table scan might be acceptable in small tables, as your data grows, understanding and utilizing indexes can make a world of difference in performance.\nEven in this simple query, we've uncovered the critical role the query planner plays in determining how to retrieve your data efficiently, and how small changes—like adding an index—can lead to significant performance gains.\nIn the next sections, we’ll dive deeper into more complex queries and see how SQLite handles more challenging scenarios, giving you the tools to write even more efficient SQL code.\n\nComplex Query Example: Getting to the Heart of the Optimizer\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s look at a more complicated query that gives SQLite’s optimizer something to chew on.\nImagine we have two tables, DRINKER and BEER, and we want to perform a query that joins them to find out which beers each drinker likes, sorted by their preference. The schema might look something like this:\n\nAnd let's populate the tables with some example data:\n\nNow, suppose we want to find out which beers each drinker likes, sorted by their preference:\n\nThis query isn’t as simple as it looks. SQLite’s optimizer has to decide:\n\nJoin Order: Should it start with the DRINKER, LIKES, or BEER table?\nIndex Usage: Which indexes, if any, can be used to speed up the joins and the sorting?\nSorting: How should the results be sorted efficiently after the joins?\n\nUnderstanding the Query Plan: What Happens Behind the Scenes\nWhen we look at the query plan for the complex query:\n\nWe get the following output:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      SCAN LIKES\nSEARCH DRINKER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\nUSE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY\n\n    \n    \n  \nThis output provides a high-level overview of how SQLite intends to execute the query. Let’s break down each component and understand what’s happening under the hood.\n1. Scan the LIKES Table\n\nPlan Step: SCAN LIKES\n\nSQLite begins by scanning the LIKES table. Since LIKES is the central table in this query, containing the foreign keys that link DRINKER to BEER, it makes sense for SQLite to start here.\n\nWhy a Table Scan?: The plan shows that SQLite performs a full table scan on LIKES, meaning it reads every row in the table. This might seem inefficient, but without specific indexes on DRINKER_ID or BEER_ID, a full scan is necessary to gather all the relevant data.\n\n2. Searching the DRINKER and BEER Tables\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \nPlan Steps:\n\nSEARCH DRINKER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n  \nFor each row in LIKES, SQLite needs to find the corresponding DRINKER and BEER entries. It uses the primary key indexes (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) on these tables to quickly locate the matching rows.\n\nPrimary Key Lookup: Because both DRINKER.ID and BEER.ID are defined as primary keys, SQLite can perform an efficient lookup using these indexes. The query plan indicates that for each LIKES entry, SQLite performs a quick search in both DRINKER and BEER tables to retrieve the NAME fields.\n\n3. Using a Temporary B-Tree for Sorting\n\nPlan Step: USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY\n\nThe final step in the query plan involves sorting the results. The query requests that the results be ordered by DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE. Since the data isn’t naturally ordered in this way, SQLite must perform additional work to achieve this sort order.\n\n\nTemporary B-Tree: To sort the results efficiently, SQLite creates a temporary B-tree structure. A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. By inserting the result set into this B-tree, SQLite can quickly and efficiently retrieve the data in the desired order.\n\n\nWhy Not an Index?: The need for a temporary B-tree indicates that there isn’t an existing index that supports the required sort order. This extra step adds overhead, which is why creating an appropriate index can be beneficial.\n\n\nCombining all these steps, we get the expected output:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Results of the complex query\n  \n  \n\n\nOptimizing the Query: Adding a Multi-Column Index\nAs mentioned earlier, one way to improve this query's performance is by adding an index on the LIKES table. Specifically, creating a multi-column index on the combination of DRINKER_ID and PREFERENCE would directly support the sorting required by the query:\n\nBy creating this multi-column index, SQLite can:\n\n\nAvoid Full Table Scans: With this index, SQLite can avoid a full scan of the LIKES table. Instead, it can directly jump to the relevant rows using the index, which is more efficient.\n\n\nOptimize Sorting: The index also covers the PREFERENCE column, which means the results can be retrieved in the correct order directly from the index. This eliminates the need for a temporary B-tree, reducing the query’s overall execution time.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example multicolumn index from the SQLite query planner documentation illustrating a lookup using the index.\n  \n  \n\nRe-running the Query Plan\nAfter creating the index, if we re-run the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command, we might see a different plan:\n\nThe updated plan now reflects the use of the new index:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      SCAN DRINKER\nSEARCH LIKES USING INDEX idx_likes_drinker_pref (DRINKER_ID=?)\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\nUSE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY\n\n    \n    \n  \nThis new execution plan reflects several optimizations made by SQLite:\n\n\nSCAN DRINKER:\n\nSQLite starts by scanning the DRINKER table. Since this is a full table scan, it reads each row from the DRINKER table sequentially. This step makes sense as it’s the starting point of our query, and no filters or constraints are applied to DRINKER that would allow an index to be used here.\n\n\n\nSEARCH LIKES USING INDEX idx_likes_drinker_pref (DRINKER_ID=?):\n\nHere’s where the optimization kicks in. SQLite uses the newly created index idx_likes_drinker_pref on the LIKES table. This index is likely created on the DRINKER_ID and PREFERENCE columns, allowing SQLite to efficiently find the rows in LIKES where DRINKER_ID matches the current row from the DRINKER table. This dramatically reduces the amount of data SQLite needs to sift through compared to a full table scan.\n\n\n\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?):\n\n\n\nFor the BEER table, SQLite utilizes the primary key index, which is an automatically created index on the ID column (which acts as the rowid). Since this is the most efficient way to retrieve specific rows from BEER, SQLite uses this index to quickly find the beer names corresponding to the BEER_ID values from the LIKES table.\n\n\nUSE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY:\n\nFinally, SQLite notes that it will use a temporary B-Tree to sort the results according to the ORDER BY clause (DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE). Even though indexes can often help with sorting, in this case, SQLite decides to use a temporary B-Tree structure to ensure that the results are returned in the correct order. This step can be a bit more resource-intensive, but it guarantees that the results will be sorted as requested.\n\n\n\nThe use of the idx_likes_drinker_pref index significantly improves the efficiency of the query. By avoiding a full table scan on LIKES, SQLite reduces the amount of data it needs to process, which speeds up query execution, especially on larger datasets.\nThe final ORDER BY clause requires SQLite to sort the results, and since the current indexes do not cover both DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE, SQLite opts to use a temporary B-Tree. If you frequently run this query and notice the sorting step is a bottleneck, you could consider creating a composite index on these two columns to further optimize performance.\n\nConclusion: Tips for Writing Efficient Queries\nBy peeking under the hood at how SQL queries are executed, you can gain some intuition on why certain queries are faster than others. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:\n\n\nIndex Your Foreign Keys: Always create indexes on columns used in JOIN conditions. This speeds up the process of matching rows between tables.\n\n\nUse Covering Indexes: If possible, create indexes that cover all the columns your query needs, so SQLite doesn’t need to access the main table at all.\n\n\nWrite Selective WHERE Clauses: If your WHERE clause can quickly eliminate rows from consideration, your query will run faster. The fewer rows SQLite has to process, the better.\n\n\nAvoid Redundant Sorting: If you know your data is already sorted in the way you want, avoid using ORDER BY. It just adds unnecessary processing time.\n\n\nOptimize Subqueries: Subqueries can sometimes be rewritten as joins, which might be more efficient, especially if the subquery’s result set is large.\n\n\nUnderstand the Query Planner: Use tools like EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to understand how SQLite executes your queries. Sometimes, a small change in the query structure can lead to a big performance improvement.\n\n\nLearning to write efficient SQL queries is a valuable skill that translates across all database systems and can make a significant difference in your application’s performance, scalability, and resource usage. Like most things, it takes practice and experimentation and this post just scratches the surface of optimizing queries.

How could that be possible? This is the story of how a\nseemingly innocuous image format, WebP, was discovered to have a critical\nvulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a victim's\nmachine.\nUnderstanding Image Formats and Background on WebP\nUnder the hood, images are just binary data that represent pixels on a screen.\nDifferent image formats encode this data in various ways, each with its own\nstrengths and weaknesses. Some formats, like JPEG and PNG, are well-known and\nwidely used. Others, like Google's WebP format, are newer and less common but\noffer advantages such as better compression and transparency support. When a\nuser opens any picture, the picture has to be rendered on the screen by the\ncomputer by decoding the binary data contained in the image file. This decoding\nprocess is handled by an image decoder, which reads the image data, interprets\nit, and displays the image on the screen. The decoder must understand the\nspecific format of the image file to perform this task correctly.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: The process of encoding and decoding a JPEG image.\n  \n  \n\nYou'll often hear about image formats being \"lossy\" or \"lossless.\" Lossy\nformats, like JPEG, discard some image data to achieve higher compression\nratios, while lossless formats, like PNG, preserve all the original data. WebP\nis unique in that it can be both lossy and lossless, depending on the settings\nused during encoding. This flexibility makes it a popular choice for web\ndevelopers looking to balance image quality and file size.\nThe libwebp is a popular open-source library that is used to encode and decode\nWebP images. It is widely used in web browsers, image editing software, and\nother applications that support the WebP format. The library provides functions\nfor reading and writing WebP images, as well as encoding and decoding the pixel\ndata. The vulnerability in WebP that we will discuss later is related to the\nlossless encoding and decoding process used by the libwebp library.\nThe Complexity of Huffman Encoding and Decoding\nWebP's lossless variant is based on a technique called Huffman encoding, which\nis used to compress data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols.\nThis process involves building a binary tree where each symbol corresponds to a\nunique path from the root to a leaf node. The tree is then used to encode and\ndecode the data efficiently.\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a simple example where we have four symbols\n(A, B, C, and D) whose frequencies are as follows:\n\nA: 50%\nB: 25%\nC: 15%\nD: 10%\n\nThe Huffman tree for these symbols might look like this:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n    \n  \n\nIn this tree, the symbol A is encoded as 0, B as 10, C as 110, and D as\n111. When encoding a sequence of symbols, we traverse the tree from the root\nto the leaf node corresponding to each symbol, generating a binary code along\nthe way. This process ensures that more frequent symbols are assigned shorter\ncodes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data.\nHuffman tables are used to store the mapping between symbols and their\ncorresponding codes. These tables are typically constructed during the encoding\nprocess and are required for decoding the data. For the example above, the\nHuffman table might look like this:\nSymbolCode\nA0\nB10\nC110\nD111\n\nAs you can see, the most frequent symbol (A) is assigned the shortest code,\nwhile the least frequent symbol (D) is assigned the longest code. This property\nof Huffman encoding helps achieve efficient compression by reducing the average\ncode length. Huffman tables effectively capture the structure of the Huffman\ntree, with one table per alphabet size (number of symbols) used in the encoding\nprocess.\nIn the case of WebP, the Huffman tree is stored in the image file along with the\nencoded pixel data. When the image is decoded, the tree is reconstructed, and\nthe pixel data is decoded using the tree's structure.\nThe WebP Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4863)\nIn September 2023, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the WebP image\nformat that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine.\nThe vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-4863, was caused by a heap buffer overflow\nin the Huffman decoding process. By crafting a specially designed WebP image, an\nattacker could trigger the overflow and overwrite memory in the decoder, leading\nto a variety of potential exploits.\nBut triggering the vulnerability is not as simple as sending a malicious image\nfile to a victim. The attacker must carefully construct the image to exploit the\nspecific conditions that trigger the heap buffer overflow. This requires a deep\nunderstanding of the WebP format and the internal workings of the decoder,\nmaking it a non-trivial task even for experienced security researchers.\nBen Hawkes, the Project Zero team lead at Google, described the following steps\nto trigger the vulnerability:\n\n\nConstruct a sequence of 4 valid Huffman tables that are maximally sized for\ntwo different alphabet sizes (280 and 256).\n\n\nNext, construct a very specific type of invalid Huffman table for a third\nalphabet size (40).\n\n\nFinally, the vulnerability will be manifested in the BuildHuffmanTable\nfunction in the libwebp library when the invalid Huffman table is\nprocessed. The issue is that there was no length check on the buffer that was\nallocated for the Huffman table, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write\nwhen the invalid table is unpacked by the decoder. This means the function\ncould be coerced into writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to an\nout-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. The overflow will lead\nto a double-free vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary\ncode.\n\n\nIf any of the above steps are not followed correctly, the vulnerability will not\nbe triggered and the image decoder will simply throw an error. Practically, this\nmeans that exploiting the vulnerability requires a high level of expertise and\nknowledge of the WebP format, making it unlikely to be used in widespread\nattacks.\nmistymntncop, a security researcher, created\na proof-of-concept exploit for the WebP vulnerability, and produced this\nvisualization of the unbalanced Huffman table the is constructed from the\ncrafted WebP image:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: An unbalanced Huffman tree created\nfrom a crafted WebP image.\n  \n  \n\nIn contrast, here is the visualization balanced Huffman tree created from a\nvalid WebP image:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: A balanced Huffman tree created\nfrom a valid WebP image.\n  \n  \n\n\nHow Was This Not Caught Earlier?\nEven though there are many fuzzing tools and techniques available to detect\nvulnerabilities in software, the reason this bug was not caught earlier is\nmostly due to the sheer complexity and specificity of the conditions required to\ntrigger it. As Hawkes mentions in his zero-day disclosure, \"[o]ut of billions\nof possibilities,\" only a 4 table sequence of a specific size and an invalid\ntable of a specific size will trigger the vulnerability.\nTo see for yourself how complex the conditions are, you can check out the nearly\n600-line C code that was used to trigger the vulnerability\nhere.\nConclusion\nThis vulnerability has since been patched, so if you're using the most recent\nversions of your browsers than you can rest easy that you're not susceptible to\nthis attack. However, the WebP vulnerability serves as a reminder that security\nvulnerabilities can lurk in unexpected places, even in seemingly benign image\nformats. As software systems become more complex and interconnected, it is\nessential to conduct thorough security assessments of all components, including\nimage decoders and parsers. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities\nproactively, we can help prevent potential exploits and protect users from\nmalicious attacks.\nReferences\n-\nJPEG Image Encoding and Decoding Figure\n\n- Uncovering the Hidden WebP vulnerability: a tale of a CVE with much bigger implications than it originally seemed\n\n- CVE-2023-4863 Detail \n- WEBP’S WEAK SPOT: UNVEILING THE HIDDEN VULNERABILITY\n\n- The WebP 0day \n- Explanation from the Youtube channel Low Level Learning\n\n- Proof-of-Concept for CVE-2023-4863 by Hawkes and mistymntncop\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/webp-vulnerability/","title":"WebP: A Case Study in the Hidden Vulnerabilities of Image Formats"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/welcome/":{"body":"\n  \n    \n\n    \n      \n\n    \n    \n  \nCongratulations!
