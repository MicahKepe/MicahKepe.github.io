&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are all around us. They are the invisible forces that power our modern world, from the search engines we use to find information to the social networks we use to connect with friends and family. In this post, I share some ingenious algorithms that I have learned about both in courses and through my own research.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year ago, I took an online course called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;missing.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Missing Semester of Your CS Education&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The course was created by a group of MIT students and covers a wide range of topics that are often overlooked in traditional computer science curriculums. The course is designed to help students become more productive and efficient programmers by teaching them essential skills that are not typically taught in school.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still to this day, I find myself using many of the tools and techniques that I learned in the course. In this post, I will share some of the biggest takeaways from The Missing Semester of Your CS Education and how they have helped me become a better, more productive programmer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
