As part of my design course requirements at Rice University, I will be creating
a game in a group of 4 using the Godot engine over the upcoming semester. This
blog post will serve as a progress log for the game's development and hopefully
provide some good insights into the game development process from someone who
has never made a game before.

# Initial Project Proposal

I don't want to give too much away, but our game is called **43Monkeys** and
draws a lot of inspiration from this news source:
[What we know after 43 monkeys escaped a South Carolina research facility](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-what-we-know/)

A lot is still up in the air (open-source or not, full storyboard, etc.), but
I'm excited to see where this project goes. I'll be updating this post as we
make progress, so stay tuned!
