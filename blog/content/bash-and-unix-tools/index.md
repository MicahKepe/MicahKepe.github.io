With just a basic working knowledge of writing Bash scripts and understanding
Unix tools and their design philosophy, you can easily create scripts to
automate your workflow and improve your productivity. In this post, we'll get
our feet wet in writing Bash scripts and combine them with some powerful Unix
tools to create a powerful and versatile toolset.

## Introduction

As a college student, I find that most of my peers have little to no experience  
with the command line interface (CLI) and Unix tools. This is unfortunate, as
personally after discovering Vim, tmux, and other Unix tools, I have found that
I have become more productive, enjoyed writing code more, and have a better
understanding of how my machine works. This is not to say that editors like
Visual Studio Code or IDEs are bad (I myself used Visual Studio Code for a long
time), but rather that Unix tools provide a different way of working that can
be more efficient and enjoyable for some people. Even if you don't end up using
Unix tools in your daily workflow, understanding them can be beneficial, as they
are the foundation of many modern tools and technologies.

### Unix Philosophy

Before diving into Unix tools, it is important to understand the Unix philosophy,
not only because it is the foundation of Unix tools, but also because it is a
design philosphy that leads to the powerful combinations and versatility of Unix
tools.

The following diagram illustrates the Unix philosophy:

- `tldr`

- `fzf`

- `rg`

- `tmux`

- `sed` and `awk`
