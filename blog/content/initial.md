Congratulations! You have found my hidden blog. This blog is not advertised or linked to from anywhere on my site so you must have been snooping around. It is a hidden gem that only the most curious and adventurous visitors will discover. 
<!-- more -->
I'm not sure what I will use this blog for yet, but I'm thinking it will be a place for me to share personal stories, thoughts, and reflections that don't quite fit into the rest of my site.

For those curious, this blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust, because I am too lazy to write the code myself ("The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris." - Larry Wall). The theme is a custom theme called "After Dark" that can be found [here](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark).

Be warned-- though you found this blog this time, I think I will make it even harder to find in the future. Stay tuned for more hidden gems and easter eggs on my site. Until then, enjoy this little scavenger hunt victory!
