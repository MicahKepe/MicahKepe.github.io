I **love** databases, but they are still largely a magical black box to me, so in this post, I'm going to explore how SQLite's query optimizer works. We'll delve together into how the process of how SQL queries are parsed, optimized, and executed, in particular focusing on the optimization phase. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how SQLite's query optimizer works and how it can help you write more efficient queries.
