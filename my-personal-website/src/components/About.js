        I am a computer science student at Rice University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science. Since I was a child, I have loved puzzles and solving problems, and the world of computer science offers a vast amount of novel solutions for the problems of today and the future. It is my hope that with the technical skills I learn from Rice, alongside my drive to constantly push myself outside my limits, that I can create meaningful and impactful work that will help address issues in our increasingly interconnected world.

        As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to connect with industry professionals, fellow students, and potential mentors to exchange ideas and explore opportunities in computer science and data science fields. I am open to internships, research collaborations, and networking opportunities to further enhance my skills and contribute to impactful projects. Please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn!
